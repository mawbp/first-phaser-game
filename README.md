## How to play?
---

Actually it's easy, if you already know about web develoopment. All you need is a web server and browser.
You can use any web server i.e (XAMPP), you just need to clone or download this repo and put inside your htdocs, and open it through your browser.
Or you can do a simpler way by using PHP Built-In web server. You need to type this command inside your terminal. make sure you're inside this repo.

```bash
php -S localhost:8000
```


Enjoy the Game :)
